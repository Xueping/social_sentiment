# Outputs Structure

There are two topics under outputs folder, such as, 'Face Masks' and 'Mental Health'.

Under each topic folder, there are two sub folders: 'weekly_incremental_report_data' and 'weekly_incremental_tweets_data'.

CSV files under 'weekly_incremental_report_data' are used to dashboard. And CSV files under 'weekly_incremental_tweets_data' are used for exploring detailed data.

Two zip files can be downloaded to use.
